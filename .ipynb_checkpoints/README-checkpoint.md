# Learning-curves-for-DRP
Using learning curves for the comparison of multiple modalities performance at anti-cancer drug response prediction (DRP) with both neural networks and XGBoost.

For code relating to CLS38 the cell lines with phosphoproteomics proteomics and RNA-seq profiles see folder: CLS38_phos_prot_RNA.

For code relating to CLS877 the cell lines with just proteomics and RNA-seq profiles see folder: CLS877_RNA_prot.

The two yml files give the conda environments that I used for kears TensorFlow and XGBoost.
